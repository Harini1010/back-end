This work potrays a simple coding of the back end.
Here the coding has been done by using php as the server side language.
Since the coding was done in a localhost using the XAMPP software, in which a database named "php_sample" was created and it consisted of a table called "details" containing the following fieds: "name" , "age","gender","address","phone number","email id","password", in which the transactions are carried out.
This code gets the details of the forms, handles the validation in the front end and the backend and displays the details collected and handles all the errors.
